# DiceTactics

I wrote this game in 2014 a few months into learning Python.  I wrote this code in the span of a week.  There are issues here, such
as heavily coupled modules, that I have learned to avoid since writing this.  I also wrote this before I began following PEP8 guidelines,
so it is not the most Pythonic looking code.
